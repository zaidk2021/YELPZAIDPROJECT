Hello and Welcome to YelpCamp!
YelpCamp is a final project as part of a websites building course.

YelpCamp is used as a platform for searching and finding camping sites. The user will be able to search and find hundreds of different camping sites, and also will be able to filter them by price, so he can find camping sites that suit him financially.

After registering and login, the user will be able to create, update and delete camping sites. Also, the user will be able to rate and leave reviews on other camping sites. It is important to note that each user will be able to update and delete camping sites that ONLY he created (this note also applies to ratings and reviews).

A map showing all the camping sites is displayed on the site's home page.

The technologies I used to build YelpCamp:
Client Side:
HTML
CSS
EJS
Bootstrap
Server Side:
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
External Tools:
Cloudinary - A solution for developers and marketers to manage images, videos and other rich media assets.
Mapbox - Maps and location for developers.
Starability.css - Accessible rating with animations on top.
